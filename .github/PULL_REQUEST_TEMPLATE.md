# Information

<!-- Change each checkbox to [x] (all lowercase, with no spaces between the brackets) to mark it as completed. -->
- [ ] I've updated the `domains.js` file correctly and add the domain data in the form given below.
- [ ] I've provided the short description about the service.
- [ ] If the service does not have a GitHub repository, I have correctly inserted **null** without the inverted commas (" ") in the repo data. For example: `repo: null,`.

### Data Structure
<!-- This is the correct domain data structure. -->
```js
{
  name: "DOMAIN PROVIDER SERVICE NAME OR DOMAIN NAME WITHOUT `https://`",
  url: "FULL LINK TO THE WEBSITE",
  description: "A SHORT DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE SERVICE",
  repo: "ONLY ROUTE TO GITHUB REPOSIOTYR IF THERE IS ONE, E.G harys722/free-domains ELSE null",
  available: A BOOLEAN VALUE IF THE DOMAIN IS AVAILABLE FOR NOW (true OR false)
}
```
